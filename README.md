# Pac Men Factory
This project was an assignment we did in class in which we worked with a template of a Pac-Man machine that will create pacmen and have them move randomly.

# How to Run
To run this application you can either go to my portfolio at github.com/porfolio.io OR to run this code you will need to add each file from GitHub to new files in whatever code editor you are using. If you don't use the same file names you will need to change the links for the files. It is better to run it with a live server. If you don't have one, you can download "Live Server" as an extension (Vs Studio). Run the HTML as a live server and it will run as needed.
 
 #Road Map
 
In the future, I could add another button that will fully stop them and io can add more images to make their mouth move as they move as well
